# DS2002_midterm_project

The SQL folder contains all the work I did through MySQL where I created and loaded the data into the database. In SQL, I also created and populated the dimension tables as well as the fact table (in HR_managament_DW) and performed ETL processing.

The Python folder contains the file "PythonETL_HR_management_DW2" where I used python to perform this ETL processing and created another data warehouse caled "HR_management_DW2". The end of this file also contains the aggregation I did.

Another file in the Python folder is "MongoDB_ETL_HR_management" where I used python and MongoDB to perform ETL processing and created another data warehouse called "HR_management_DW3".

The "data" folder contains the .json filed I used for the ETL processing I did with MongoDB.
